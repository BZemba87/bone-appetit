        - ### Design

        - #### Colour Scheme
        - The colours I chose for Bone Appetit are #FFF6FE (very light shade of magenta); #FE94AD (light red); black and #36454F (charcoal).  As it is a cafe website, the colours have to provide a taste of the cafe's personality which is a good balance of being fun and attractive but also professional.  

        - #### Typography 
        - The Open Sans is used for the body and Roboto Slab is used for the headings and footer.  Sans-serif is selected as the fallback font if there is a problem with importing either font to the site.  Both fonts have been imported from Google Fonts and are easy to read and look nice and sleek.

        - ### Imagery
        - The background image on the home page is eye catching and relevant for a dog cafe site with a purpose to attract dog lovers.  It's modern and minimalist look sets the tone for the entire cafe.

Layout and Content:

- The Home page has some welcome text and a background image.
- The Menus page has menus available in the cafe for dogs and humans plus a little note about food intolerances.
- The Book page has a booking form to reserve a table that requires name, email, phone, date, time and a dropdown menu to select number of guests.   An image is alongside the booking form.

Hover effect on links:

- Indicates to the user the location of the mouse whilst navigating the menu on the navigation bar.
- A background colour (rgba(254,148,173,0.7) has been set for active links so the user knows which page they are currently on.

Reserve Your Table Form:

- Form validation requests user to input correct information in input fields when the 'Request Booking' button is pressed - this stops the user from submitting incorrect information.
